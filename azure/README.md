# Azure onboarding scripts (deprecated)

This folder is archived for historical reference. For current Azure onboarding and preflight checks, use the **cc-permissions-preflight** script instead:

* GitHub repo: https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/cc-permissions-preflight
* Latest script (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaloAltoNetworks/cc-permissions-preflight/refs/heads/main/preflight_check.sh

The PowerShell and Bash scripts here are no longer maintained and may be removed in a future release. Filenames are prefixed with `deprecated-` to discourage use:

* `deprecated-az-runtime-perms-check.sh`
* `deprecated-Start-AzCortexOnboarding.ps1`
* `deprecated-Test-AzCortexProviders.ps1`
* `deprecated-Test-AzCortexRuntimePermissions.ps1`
