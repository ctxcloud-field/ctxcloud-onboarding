## üß™ Azure Onboarding Scripts

### `az-runtime-perms-check.sh` (Bash)

Checks whether the current Azure CLI user:

* Is a **Global Admin** in Entra ID
* Has role assignments at both **Subscription** and **Root Management Group**
* Has wildcard permissions for key services used by **Cortex Runtime Security**
* Has all required **Azure Resource Providers** registered

**Usage:**

```bash
cd azure
chmod +x az-runtime-perms-check.sh
./az-runtime-perms-check.sh
```

> Designed for Bash 3.x (e.g., macOS default). No `jq` or external dependencies required.

---

### `Test-AzCortexRuntimePermissions.ps1`

PowerShell version of the permission validator:

* Validates wildcard permissions per Azure service category
* Shows roles granted at root and subscription levels
* Can be extended to export reports or run in pipelines

```powershell
cd azure
.\Test-AzCortexRuntimePermissions.ps1
```

---

### `Test-AzCortexProviders.ps1`

Checks registration status for all Azure resource providers needed by Cortex Cloud and prompts for registration if needed.

```powershell
cd azure
.\Test-AzCortexProviders.ps1
```

---

### `Start-AzCortexOnboarding.ps1`

Convenience wrapper that runs both of the above PowerShell checks.

```powershell
cd azure
.\Start-AzCortexOnboarding.ps1
```
